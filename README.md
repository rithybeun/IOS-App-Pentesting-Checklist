# IOS App Pentesting Checklist

**Welcome to the "IOS App Penetration Testing Checklist" Repository!**

Explore the ultimate companion for IOSapp penetration testing, meticulously crafted to identify vulnerabilities in network, data, storage, and permissions effortlessly. This repository merges a comprehensive checklist of tasks and cutting-edge techniques, providing security professionals with a robust framework for a thorough security assessment of IOS applications.

The checklist covers a range of topics, including:

**Static analysis:** reviewing the app's source code and resources for potential vulnerabilities

**Dynamic analysis:** analyzing the app's behavior and interactions with the device and network during runtime

**Network analysis:** analyzing the app's communication with servers and other external resources over the network

**Permission analysis:** reviewing the app's requested permissions and assessing whether they are appropriate and secure

**Cryptographic analysis:** reviewing the app's use of cryptography and ensuring that it is implemented securely

**Data storage analysis:** analyzing the app's handling of sensitive data, including how it is stored and transmitted

This checklist is intended as a starting point for penetration testers and bug bounty hunters to identify common security issues in IOS applications. It is not a comprehensive guide to all possible security issues and should be used in conjunction with other resources and best practices.

#Tools-Installation

**Grapefruit Installation**


Grapefruit is an IOS app assessment tools that is using the FRIDA server on the iOS Device and is abstracting many penetration testing tasks in to a Web UI. It can be installed via npm.

```bash
$ npm install -g igf
```
```bash
$ grapefruit
```
With Grapefruit it's possible to explore different kinds of information concerning an iOS app. Once you selected the iOS app you can perform many tasks such as:
- Get information about the binary
- View folders and files used by the application and download them
- Inspect the Info.plist
- Get a UI Dump of the app screen shown on the iOS device
- List the modules that are loaded by the app
- Dump class names
- Dump keychain items

**ios-deploy Installation**


With ios-deploy you can install and debug iOS apps from the command line, without using Xcode. It can be installed via brew on macOS:

```bash
$ brew install ios-deploy
```
Alternatively:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ios-control/ios-deploy.git
cd ios-deploy/
xcodebuild
cd build/Release
./ios-deploy
ln -s <your-path-to-ios-deploy>/build/Release/ios-deploy /usr/local/bin/ios-deploy
```
The last line creates a symbolic link and makes the executable available system-wide. Reload your shell to make the new commands available:
```bash
zsh: # . ~/.zshrc
bash: # . ~/.bashrc
```
