# IOS App Pentesting Checklist

**Welcome to the "IOS App Penetration Testing Checklist" Repository!**

Explore the ultimate companion for IOSapp penetration testing, meticulously crafted to identify vulnerabilities in network, data, storage, and permissions effortlessly. This repository merges a comprehensive checklist of tasks and cutting-edge techniques, providing security professionals with a robust framework for a thorough security assessment of IOS applications.

The checklist covers a range of topics, including:

**Static analysis:** reviewing the app's source code and resources for potential vulnerabilities

**Dynamic analysis:** analyzing the app's behavior and interactions with the device and network during runtime

**Network analysis:** analyzing the app's communication with servers and other external resources over the network

**Permission analysis:** reviewing the app's requested permissions and assessing whether they are appropriate and secure

**Cryptographic analysis:** reviewing the app's use of cryptography and ensuring that it is implemented securely

**Data storage analysis:** analyzing the app's handling of sensitive data, including how it is stored and transmitted

This checklist is intended as a starting point for penetration testers and bug bounty hunters to identify common security issues in IOS applications. It is not a comprehensive guide to all possible security issues and should be used in conjunction with other resources and best practices.

#Tools-Installation

**Grapefruit Installation**


Grapefruit is an IOS app assessment tools that is using the FRIDA server on the iOS Device and is abstracting many penetration testing tasks in to a Web UI. It can be installed via npm.

```bash
npm install -g igf


grapefruit

```
With Grapefruit it's possible to explore different kinds of information concerning an iOS app. Once you selected the iOS app you can perform many tasks such as:
- Get information about the binary
- View folders and files used by the application and download them
- Inspect the Info.plist
- Get a UI Dump of the app screen shown on the iOS device
- List the modules that are loaded by the app
- Dump class names
- Dump keychain items

**ios-deploy Installation**


With ios-deploy you can install and debug iOS apps from the command line, without using Xcode. It can be installed via brew on macOS:

```bash
brew install ios-deploy
```
Alternatively:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ios-control/ios-deploy.git
cd ios-deploy/
xcodebuild
cd build/Release
./ios-deploy
ln -s <your-path-to-ios-deploy>/build/Release/ios-deploy /usr/local/bin/ios-deploy
```
The last line creates a symbolic link and makes the executable available system-wide. Reload your shell to make the new commands available:
```bash
zsh: # . ~/.zshrc
bash: # . ~/.bashrc
```


**SwiftShield Installation**

SwiftShield ↗ is a tool that generates irreversible, encrypted names for your iOS project's objects (including your Pods and Storyboards). This raises the bar for reverse engineers and will produce less helpful output when using reverse engineering tools such as class-dump and Frida.

A sample Swift project is used to demonstrate the usage of SwiftShield.

Check out [(sushi2k/SwiftSecurity ↗.)](https://github.com/sushi2k/SwiftSecurity)
Open the project in Xcode and make sure that the project is building successfully (Product / Build or Apple-Key + B).
[(Download ↗)](https://github.com/rockbruno/swiftshield/releases) the latest release of SwiftShield and unzip it.
Go to the directory where you downloaded SwiftShield and copy the swiftshield executable to /usr/local/bin:

```bash
cp swiftshield/swiftshield /usr/local/bin/
```
In your terminal go into the SwiftSecurity directory (which you checked out in step 1) and execute the command swiftshield (which you downloaded in step 3):
```bash
$ cd SwiftSecurity
$ swiftshield -automatic -project-root . -automatic-project-file SwiftSecurity.xcodeproj -automatic-project-scheme SwiftSecurity
```
SwiftShield is now detecting class and method names and is replacing their identifier with an encrypted value.

In the original source code you can see all the class and method identifiers:

SwiftShield was now replacing all of them with encrypted values that leave no trace to their original name or intention of the class/method:
